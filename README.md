# 🔐 Password Strength & Breach Checker

A fullstack app built with **React + Tailwind (via CDN)** on the frontend and **Node.js + Express** on the backend. It allows users to:

- Check **password strength** (real-time feedback)
- Detect if a password has appeared in **known data breaches** using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange) API


## Features
- Real-time password strength evaluation
- Breach checking using the Pwned Passwords API
- SHA-1 hashing with prefix match (privacy-safe)
- Modern, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- Full separation of frontend and backend
